MUnit v0.4.x did not support truly async tests on platforms like JavaScript. For
example, the following test case would succeed even if it returns a failing
future:

```scala
test("should fail after 100 milliseconds") {
  val p = Promise[Unit]()
  setTimeout(100) {
    p.failure(new RuntimeException("boom"))
  }
  p.future
}
```

The latest MUnit v0.5.0 release fixes this issue by adding support for async
tests on all platforms meaning that the example test case above fails as
expected after 100 milliseconds.

## Breaking changes

If you did not override any `munit*` methods then you should be able to upgrade
to v0.5.0 easily. Most commonly used methods like `test("name") { ... }` are
unchanged in this release.

The breaking changes in this release mostly involve replacing `Any` with
`Future[Any]`.

```diff
-- MUnit v0.4.x
++ MUnit v0.5.x

-  def munitTestValue(body: Any): Any
+  def munitTestValue(body: => Any): Future[Any]

-  def munitRunTest(options: TestOptions, body: Any): Any
+  def munitRunTest(options: TestOptions, body: () => Future[Any]): Future[Any]

-  def munitExpectFailure(options: TestOptions, body: Any): Any
+  def munitExpectFailure(options: TestOptions, body: () => Future[Any]): Future[Any]

-  def munitFlaky(options: TestOptions, body: Any): Any
+  def munitFlaky(options: TestOptions, body: () => Future[Any]): Future[Any]
```

To give an example how to migrate from the old API to the new API. The docs
demonstrated how to automatically start evaluating a lazy future called `Task`
by overriding `munitTestValue`. The old override looked like this:

```scala
override def munitTestValue(testValue: Any): Any =
  testValue match {
    case Task(run) => Await.result(run(), munitTimeout)
    case _ => super.munitTestValue(testValue)
  }
```

The override with the new signature now looks like this instead:

```scala
override def munitTestValue(testValue: => Any): Future[Any] =
  super.munitTestValue(testValue).flatMap {
    case LazyFuture(run) => run()
    case value => Future.successful(value)
  }
```
